# Oklahoma County Detention Center (OCDC) Data Dashboard Updates

> The OCDC Data Dashboard was created by [Open Justice Oklahoma (OJO)](https://openjustice.okpolicy.org/), a program of [the Oklahoma Policy Institute](https://okpolicy.org/), on behalf of the [Oklahoma County Criminal Justice Advisory Council (CJAC)](https://www.okcountycjac.com/). The dashboard draws its data from the OJO database, which draws its data from the OCDC's "Jailtracker" data system each week on Mondays at 12PM CST.

## Updates to our data:

* *April 20, 2023* | In our database, we updated 12 booking records that were previously missing release dates, and removed 44 booking records that were later overwritten or deleted in the OCDC's Jailtracker system. These missing / duplicate records were being counted as if the person remained in the jail (as they had booking dates but no release dates), and thus the total current jail population was previously being overestimated by around 30-60 people. This is now corrected.
